Troubleshooting info:
- Will crash if used with Soku2 older than version 2.30g
- Will crash if used with InfiniteDecks
- Will crash if giuroll is loaded after this mod
- Will crash or make the HUD act weird if used with CharacterInForeground (even if CiF+ is set to OFF)
- HUD mods in general may either not work or mess up the custom HUD
- Requires the latest version of SokuModLoader (at least version 0.4.1): if not, you may see error 45a, or some instabilities
- Requires the latest version of giuroll (at least version 0.6.18): if not, it will cause desyncs when using the mod's mechanics

Known issues:
- Sometimes when using cards, the card text ends up being a solid white box.
- Replays don't work properly (in particular, loadouts and tag characters aren't saved in the replays)

Common problems:
"Failed to load TagSoku.dll: Loading failed: 45a" or
"Failed to load TagSoku.dll: Loading failed: A dynamic link library (DLL) initialization routine failed."
"Failed to load TagSoku.dll: Loading failed: <Insert other cryptic error>."
 - Try using using the latest SokuModLoader, or updating yours.
"Game crashed! ... exception C0000005 at address ########" (8 digits and letters) during startup, or when loading in game
 - Make sure the assets.dat folder is next to the DLL, and that you have no data folder next to the game's EXE.
"Game crashed! ... exception C0000005 at address #######" (6 or 7 digits and letters) during startup
 - Make sure that InfiniteDecks is disabled.
